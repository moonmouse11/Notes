## Fundamental
- No classes, but structs with methods
- Interfaces
- No implementation inheritance. There's type embedding, though.
- Functions are first class citizens
- Functions can return multiple values
- Has closures
- Pointers, but not pointer arithmetic
- Built-in concurrency primitives: Goroutines and Channels
